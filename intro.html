<p>Bramall Hall is a black and white Tudor mansion, located eight miles south of Manchester in the town of Stockport. Built in 1370 by the Davenport family, Bramall Hall has been witness to some of the most turbulant periods of British History. The Davenports lived at the Hall until the late 19th century, at which point it was bought by the Nevill Family. It was also briefly owned by John Davies, the first chairman of Manchester United Football Club, before being sold to the current owners Stockport Council in 1935.<br><br>

I have been fortunate enough to work here since 2016. On my first day at the hall, a volunteer told me of a terrifying experience she had many years earlier, and ever since I have been collecting the ghost stories the hall seems to generate. Some might call such tales fanciful nonsense, but if you were to visit the hall and experience its atmosphere, you may not be so sure. Whilst not a believer myself, I have had two experiences happen to me that I am still unsure of how to explain. <br><br>

What follows are a small selection of the stories and sightings that I have come across in the last five years. There are many more ghostly tales concerning the damned denizens of Bramall Hall, but the best way to hear them is to visit it yourself! </p>
