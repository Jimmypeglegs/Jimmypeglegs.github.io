<p>Two years ago, an ex-tour guide at the hall visited to see the Christmas decorations. Whilst there, she told me about an incident that happened to her at Bramall Hall in the late 1990s. She was assisting on a colleague's tour, waiting a few rooms back behind the group to close up at the end of the day. <br><br>

Standing on the landing above the chapel, she looked up at the old stairs leading to what used to be (up until the 1920s) the male servant's quarters. About eight feet away, she saw a woman in a long white gown creeping furtively down the stairs, before vanishing at the bottom. The ex-tour guide told me that the woman looked like she was trying hard to be as furtive as possible.<br><br>

Was this a repeat of a romantic assignation from potentially centuries ago? The male servant's quarters have been closed to the public for several years, due to a colony of protected bats living in the attic space.</p>
