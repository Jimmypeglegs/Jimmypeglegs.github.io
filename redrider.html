<p>The oldest ghost story of Bramall Hall is the Red Rider. The tale goes that centuries ago, a rider clad in red appeared at the hall on a stormy night and claimed sanctuary, with the elderly Lord Davenport granting the nameless knight a room. In the morning, the old Lord was found dead in his bed, and the rider was nowhere to be found.<br><br>

From that point on, whenever a doomed Davenport was about to perish the Red Rider would be seen racing up the drive to the hall, accompanied by a fierce storm. On the night of John Davies' (the last private owner) death in 1927, a fierce storm battered the park and Hall. The butler of the Hall reported that the large oak front door was blown open, and he could hear what sounded like a horse's hooves racing away down the drive.<br><br>

The legend holds that if you want to see the Red Rider for yourself, take a torch and visit the park on New Year's Eve. At the stroke of midnight, you may just catch a glimpse of a figure dressed in red galloping on a horse up the drive.</p>
