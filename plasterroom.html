<p>The Plaster Room can be found on the first floor in the middle of the central wing. Built in the 16th century, for many years it was the living space for the first-born sons of the Davenport family. The name refers to the plaster floor, which is now protected by a false wooden platform on top.<br><br>
    
This room is reputed to be the most haunted room in the Hall. There are more tales centred here than any other part, with dogs refusing to go in and burly builders being terrorised by a malicious entity. This is my experience.<br><br>

One Saturday evening in the summer of 2018, I was closing the first floor of the Hall. The only other person in the Hall was on the ground floor in another wing. I reached the Plaster Room, and started to shut the door to the Paradise Bedroom located off to one the side. I was struggling with the door's Victorian bolt, so I had my back to the room.<br><br>

Behind me, there was a deafening crash which shook the room. I spun around in alarm, thinking the suit of armour had fallen over. The room was completely still, with nothing out of place. Upon retrospect, it felt like someone extremely heavy had jumped from the stairs on the right onto the false wooden floor. <br><br>

Needless to say, I beat a brave retreat.</p>
