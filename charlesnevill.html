<p>This is Bramall Hall's most recent reported sighting, from October 2019. Two visitors were walking around the medieval Chapel, and after a few minutes they were joined by a man in an old-fashioned brown suit. As they were staring up at the 16th century painting on the back wall, they became aware of the man, who came and stood next to them, also looking up.<br><br>

When they looked back down, the man in the brown suit had vanished. Understandably flustered, they reported it to a member of staff on the front door, the only way in or out from the Hall. No such person had entered or left. On description, the man in the brown suit closely resembled Charles Nevill. With his wife Mary, Charles owned the house from 1883 until his death in 1916.<br><br>

We also have a report from Charles himself about the Chapel. On several occasions he heard the newly installed chapel organ playing music. At first, he thought it was his wife Mary, until he realised that the Chapel itself had been locked up some hours earlier. He decided to leave whichever past resident was investigating the instrument to their own devices.</p>
